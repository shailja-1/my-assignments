  <h1>My Favorite Hobby: Painting</h1>

  <h2>Why I Love Painting</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Painting</b> has been my favorite hobby since childhood. It allows me to express my emotions and imagination on canvas. 
    I often find myself lost in the <em>colors, strokes, and shapes</em> that come together to create something meaningful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every time I pick up a brush, I feel <a href="#">relaxed and focused</a>. It’s a perfect escape from the digital noise of daily life.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Paint</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy creating both <b>abstract</b> and <em>realistic</em> paintings. Sometimes, I paint natural landscapes, while other times I experiment with bold colors and patterns.
    <a href="#">Watercolors</a> are my favorite medium, though I occasionally use acrylics for more vibrant tones.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through painting, I not only develop patience and creativity but also get a deep sense of satisfaction and achievement.
